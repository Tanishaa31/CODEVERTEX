## PROJECT NAME
1.Chatbot with rule based responses

2.TIC-TAC-TOE AI

3.Image Captioning

4.Recommendation System

5.Face Detection and Recognition
## DESCRIPTION
1. A simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on predefined rules using pattern matching techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriate
responses. This will give you a basic understanding of natural language processing and conversation flow.

2. An AI agent that plays the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player using algorithms like Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning to make the AI player unbeatable. This project will help you 
understand game theory and basic search algorithms.

3.Combine computer vision and natural language processing to build an image captioning AI. Using pre-trained image recognition models lik VGG or ResNet to extract features from images, and then use a recurrent neural network (RNN) or transformer-based model to generate captions for those images.

4.Create a simple recommendation system that suggests items to users based on their preferences. You can use techniques like collaborative filtering or content-based filtering to recommend movies, books, or products to users.

5.Develop an AI application that can detect and recognize faces in images or videos. Use pre-trained face detection models like Haar cascades or deep 
learning-based face detectors, and optionally add face recognition capabilities using techniques like Siamese networks or ArcFace.
## USAGE
1.Chatbot will present your firms service options, the client then select which they want. This makes them quicker to deploy, gets them up to speed quicker and has a lower cost of development.

2.TIC -TAC-TOE, it is often used as a pedagogical tool for teaching the concepts of good sportsmanship and the branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the searching of game trees.

3.Image captioning is a method to describe an image by generating a textual description. It is in massive demand for people with impaired visuals as this method helps them listen to the text with the help of AI.

4.Recommendation systems provide personalized recommendations to users, based on their past behavior, preferences, and interactions with the system. This allows users to receive recommendations that are tailored to their individual needs and interests.

5.Face detection technology is used in a wide range of applications, including security and surveillance, social media, entertainment, and marketing.Facial recognition can provide a more secure way to authenticate users or consumers. Reduced number of touchpoints. Facial recognition enables identification with less action required from the user.
